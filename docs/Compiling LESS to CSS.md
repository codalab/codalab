# Compiling CSS

#### Put your LESS files into this directory structure:

`/codalab/apps/web/static/less/`

In the `less` directory, you will find many subdirectories. Put your new LESS file in the subdirectory that is most relevant to it.

#### Run this command in the `codalab` directory, next to `package.json`

`npm run build-css`
