## What is it?
CodaLab is an open-source web-based platform that enables researchers, developers, and data scientists to collaborate, with the goal of advancing research fields where machine learning and advanced computation is used.  CodaLab helps to solve many common problems in the arena of data-oriented research through its online community where people can share worksheets and participate in competitions.

To work with competitions and worksheets on CodaLab you will first need to sign up for a free account on [codalab.org](https://www.codalab.org/accounts/signup/).

### Competitions
CodaLab competitions provide an opportunity for researchers, developers and algorithmists to create solutions for problems across a wide range of domains. In a typical competition, participants work to find the best approach for a particular problem by crafting an algorithm against "training" data. The participant can then submit their solution where it is evaluated against "competition" data. Results from all participants are compiled and displayed on a leaderboard.

#### Enter a Competition
Put your skills to the test by participating in a competition. To see a list of ongoing competitions, visit [codalab.org/competitions/](http://www.codalab.org/competitions). To sign up for a competition, visit the detail page for the competition you want to enter, and click the **Participate** tab. 

#### Host a Competition
Have a problem related to machine learning, medical imaging, or other field involving advanced computation? Organize a competition and call forth the talents of community members from far and wide! Visit the [CodaLab Wiki](https://github.com/codalab/codalab/wiki#competitions) to learn more about hosting a competition.

### Worksheets
CodaLab worksheets combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document, streamlining the research process and lowering the barrier to documenting and publishing detailed advanced computational research. You can use CodaLab worksheets to experiment and collaborate. Visit the [CodaLab Wiki](https://github.com/codalab/codalab/wiki#worksheets) to learn more about worksheets.
